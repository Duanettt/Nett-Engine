# Voxel Game Engine
![NetEngine GITHUB GIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71102885-45ec-4028-85ea-6c81e4fd2922)

A modern C++ game engine featuring voxel-based rendering, physics simulation, and modular architecture. This engine was going to be a voxel based renderer and is now being expanded into a full blown rendering engine.

## üéÆ Core Features

### Rendering System
- OpenGL-based rendering pipeline with support for:
  - Voxel-based terrain generation and rendering
  - Dynamic mesh generation and optimization
  - Multi-shader support (cube, terrain, skybox, player, lighting)
  - Texture atlas integration
  - Custom camera systems with free movement

### Input Management
- Dual-mode input system:
  - Camera mode for 3D navigation
  - UI mode for interface interaction
- Configurable key bindings
- Event-driven input handling
- Mouse capture and movement tracking
- Smooth camera controls (WASD + mouse look)

### Physics System
- Bullet Physics integration offering:
  - Rigid body dynamics
  - Collision detection and response
  - Primitive shape support (boxes, planes)
  - Debug rendering capabilities
  - Custom physics configurations per object

### Resource Management
- Robust resource handling system for:
  - Textures
  - Shaders
  - Models
  - Memory optimization
  - Resource lifetime management

### Chunk System
- Voxel-based chunk management:
  - 16x16x16 chunk size
  - Multiple block types (Air, Dirt, Grass, Stone)
  - Efficient face culling
  - Dynamic mesh generation
  - UV mapping for texture atlas

### Primitive System
- Support for basic 3D primitives:
  - Cubes
  - Planes
  - Dynamic primitive creation
  - Physics integration
  - Transform manipulation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Manager Template System
```cpp
template <typename Derived, typename T>
class Manager
```
- Singleton pattern implementation
- Type-safe resource management
- Dynamic object creation and deletion
- Thread-safe instance handling

### Event System
- Event dispatcher for system-wide communication
- Support for:
  - Key events
  - Mouse events
  - Input mode changes
  - Custom event types
